# Walmart-Sales-Forecasting
To create a model that can forecast Walmart sales to stores in the future with accuracy. In addition to expanding on previous work on this dataset, we will investigate fresh and creative ideas.

# Dataset 
Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/walmart-dataset/data

This is the historical sales data from the Walmart Store Sales file (Total 45 Walmart Stores), including sales from 2010-02-05 to 2012-11-01. A lot of variables, such as store number, date, weekly sales, holiday flag, temperature, fuel cost, CPI, unemployment rate, and holiday events, are included in it and can be utilized to forecast future sales.

# Proposal : 
This dataset went through a lot of work, including  model selection, and data preprocessing. Using new information, a number of regression models have been trained, evaluated, and predictions were generated in past.

Please join me to try out some fresh techniques for selecting models, preparing data, and fine-tuning hyperparameters. In order to more accurately forecast future sales, we will also investigate the use of time series and more advanced models.
